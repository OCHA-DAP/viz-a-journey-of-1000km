            <p>Conflict, hunger and disease, among other factors, forced nearly 700,000 people to flee South Sudan as refugees to neighbouring countries in 2017, the latest refugee data shows. More than 70 percent of those fled in the first half of 2017, which saw multiple military offensives in Upper Nile, Jonglei, and the Greater Equatoria region.</p>
            <p>Nearly 4 million people – about one in three South Sudanese - have been displaced, including more than 1.9 million internally displaced and over 2.0 million who have fled as refugees to neighbouring Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</p> 
            <p>What happens after people abandon their land, homes, jobs, and are forced to flee their country? The route to a safe place is often filled with threats.</p>

            <h4><div class='icon'></div>Fleeing Padeah Village and return</h4>
            <p>Padeah is a small village in Unity, South Sudan, which has been amongst the areas worst affected by conflict since the civil war broke out in December 2013.</p>
            <p>Jacky, 35, just lost her husband during an attack by military forces. For Jacky and her three children, it was too dangerous to stay in the area. They left everything behind and fled north to Bentiu.</p>
            <p>Bentiu protection of civilian (PoC) site was established in December 2013, right after the crisis. Since then, Bentiu PoC site has witnessed population flows in and out of its gates. Much of the movement is circular, and exits do not necessarily mean permanent relocations to a third area.</p>
            <p>Jacky and her family walked for days to arrive at Bentiu, a distance of about 120 kilometers. After declaration and signing of permanent ceasefire by parties to the conflict, she thought things would get better at home and took her family back.</p>

            <h4><div class='icon'></div>The second displacement</h4>
            <p>However, fighting between the military forces didn’t stop in war-torn Unity. Clashes erupted and the conflict continued among several rounds of peace negotiations. This time, the family fled into swamps, hiding in the bushes of Meer Island swamp.</p>
            <p>In the swamps, people survived by eating the bulbs of wild water lilies and catching fish. Some people have managed to grow food in small gardens despite the violence. After hiding in the swamp for weeks, the family moved to a temporary protection area in Leer town.</p>

            <h4><div class='icon'></div>Got assistance and arrived at Shambe</h4>
            <p>The family decided to move south. They walked to Adok port in Leer County, and got on a boat. It took them 10 hours to sail up the White Nile River, and another 100 km journey to Thair port in Panyijiar County. There, they rested and recovered for two to three days, were provided with food by host communities before they headed south to Shambe.</p>
            <p>The family was really lucky to get supplies when food insecurity has caused crisis all over South Sudan. An estimated 5.3 million people, 48 percent of the population, are currently facing acute food insecurity, despite the harvest and continued large-scale assistance.</p>

            <h4><div class='icon'></div>12 hours on the White Nile to Bor town</h4>
            <p>The family stayed in Shambe for four to five days, recovering and waiting for the next boat to Bor town. It was another 12-hour journey on the White Nile. After they travelled 200 kilometers by boat, humanitarians at Bor helped the children get vaccinated and provided the family with medical care.</p>

            <h4><div class='icon'></div>Temporary settlement at Juba PoC site</h4>
            <p>Their journey to Juba had several stops, including Gemmaiza and Terekeka in Terekeka County, Mongalla and Gondokoro in Juba County.</p> <p>After they got off the boat at Juba port, the family walked 10 km to Juba PoC site. They also received food and medical care from humanitarians. For the first time, they were able to engage in income generating activities, such as selling firewood and grass.</p>
            <p>As of July 19, 2018, the Juba PoC site hosts more than 39,000 people.</p>
            <img src='assets/graphic_Juba_Seg5.png' width='600' />
            <p>If you think their journey ended in safety, it is not necessarily the case. A lot of IDPs choose to cross border and stay in Uganda’s refugee camps. The movement is mostly circular as people constantly  leave to seek livelihood opportunities.</p>
            <p>Currently, over half the population of South Sudan relies on aid to survive, with 1.76 million people being internally displaced. <b>Violence has forced one in every three people from their homes.</b></p>
            <p>Internationally backed efforts to implement a 2015-brokered peace deal have failed repeatedly, despite multiple rounds of talks, agreements and ceasefires. Warring parties lack the political will to end the war.</p>
